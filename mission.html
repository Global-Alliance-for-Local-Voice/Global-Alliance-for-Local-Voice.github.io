                    <p>Global Alliance for Local Voice (GALV) is a nonprofit launching a website devoted to enabling people around the world with similar sociopolitical concerns to have face to face, private, online dialogue about the well being of their communities. </p>

    <p>GALV's site is a free tool to teach people about your life in your community and learn from others about their communities.</p>

    <p>We believe informative dialogue will inspire greater empathy, transformative friendships, and collaborative organizing for positive sustainable change.</p>
                    
                     <p>Please read further for more information about the theory behind this project and our goals.</p>
                    
                     <h1>The Problem</h1>
                     <p>GALV is dedicated to addressing the problem of human disconnect that currently exists under globalization.  We affect each other worldwide with our daily practices, production, and  consumption—from the fuel powering our transportation to the coffee we drink, as well as our civic participation.   </p>
                    <p>These things connect us throughout the world, but multinational companies and political authorities mediate these relationships in a top-down manner.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, most of us throughout the world remain far too disconnected from the humanity behind the products we consume and the local and international policies that dramatically impact our communities.  The human labor that produced the goods we consume remains unknown and abstract.</p>
                    <p>The communities that we are connected to feel like they are a world away.</p>
                    
                    <h1>Our Solution</h1>
                    <p>Through GALV’s site, people around the world can meet virtually to have secure (thoroughly encrypted) audiovisual dialogue about sociopolitical issues impacting their communities.  The site is designed to promote dialogue in which:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Members mutually learn from each other about global issues and how we are connected by sharing perspectives from formal education and/or understanding from life experience, such as personal stories.  We believe that formal and experiential knowledge are equally valuable.</li>
                            <li>Local residents speak out to people around the world about the issues harming them and their communities, instead of outsiders speaking 'for' them.  People around the world learn about issues in nearby and far away communities by hearing the perspectives of local residents who are most adversely affected by them and live with them daily.</li>
                            <li>Personal interaction through face to face and voice to voice connections increases empathy and brings issues that seem unreachable (in another world) into the here and now of a person’s life.</li>
                            <li>If members wish to organize around an issue, they can plan a sustainable approach together. GALV does not prescribe approaches.  Different problems require different solutions and people know about the problems they face better than anyone else.  Therefore, members collaborate with each other to: a.) communicate what their communities need or what resources they can give, b.) determine how they can work together to create positive change, and c.) take action and support each other throughout the process.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
