                    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                    <p>Global Alliance for Local Voice is devoted to providing the international public with an open source, encrypted communication and networking platform for people to hear about social issues around the world via real time conversations with locals residing in the affected communities.</p>

                    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                    <p>Local residents most adversely affected by social issues in their communities inform global discourse and inspire transformative grassroots relationships that reclaim globalized relationships dominated by top-down institutions.</p>

                     <h1>The Theory Behind Our Mission and Goals</h1>

                     <h2>The Problem</h2>
                     <p>GALV is dedicated to addressing the problem of human disconnect that currently exists under globalization.  We affect each other worldwide with our daily practices, production, and consumption—from the fuel powering our transportation to our food and water, and our civic participation.  These things connect us worldwide.  Yet, multinational companies and political authorities mediate these relationships in a top-down manner.  Meanwhile, most of us throughout the world remain far too disconnected from the humanity behind the products we consume and the local and international policies that dramatically impact our communities.  The human labor that produces the goods we consume remains largely unknown and abstract.  Communities that we are connected to are so distant that they can seem unreachable.</p>

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>Through GALV’s site, people around the world will be able to meet virtually for audiovisual or text based dialogue and interviews about sociopolitical issues impacting their communities. The site is designed to promote interaction in which:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>GALV members can feel comfortable reaching out to the global community and posting conversation requests.  These can be requests for open dialogue or interviews—to interview others or be interviewed.</li>
                            <li>GALV members engaged in dialogue mutually learn from each other about ways they are globally connected.  This includes sharing perspectives from formal education and/or life experience, such as personal narratives.  We believe that formal and experiential knowledge are equally valuable.</li>
                            <li>Conversations are encrypted end to end, so even the website administrators cannot see them.</li>
                            <li>Local residents speak out to people around the world—near and far—about the issues harming or directly affecting them and their communities, instead of outsiders speaking ‘for’ them.  In turn, people around the world learn about such issues in nearby and far away communities by hearing the perspectives of local residents who are most adversely affected by them and live with them daily.</li>
                            <li>Personal interaction, through face to face and voice to voice interaction, increases empathy and reduces spatial disconnect.  It brings matters that seem unreachable, practically a world away, into the ‘here and now’ of people’s lives.</li>
                            <li>If members wish to organize around an issue, we encourage them to plan a positive sustainable approach together.  Different problems require different solutions and people know about the problems they face better than anyone else.  Therefore, members can collaborate with each other to: a.) communicate what their communities need or what resources they can give; b.) determine how they can work together to create positive change; and c.) take action and support each other throughout the process.</li>
                        </ul>
